## Introduction

This package provides data augmentation techniques for text data using back translation and synonym replacement. Data augmentation is a technique to increase the size of the training data by generating new samples from the existing ones. This can be helpful in improving the performance of machine learning models by making them more robust and generalizable.

## Installation

You can install the package using `pip`:

```python
pip install TextBooster
```

## Usage
The package provides two functions for data augmentation: back_Translation() and synonym_Replacement().

## back_Translation()
This function performs back translation of the given text to a randomly chosen target language and then back to the source language. This can be useful in generating new samples with different sentence structures and word choices.
